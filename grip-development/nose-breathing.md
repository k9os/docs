  When you encourage a deep and full bite from your dog you close the air

# Nose Breathing

Studies show that during anaerobic \(without oxygen\) exercise, it is common to see a switch from nasal breathing to oral-nasal breathing. That is related to the resistance of airflow through the nose. Respiratory noises such as snorting are indicators of airway obstruction. If snorting occurs, we are likely asking too much from the dog regarding a full bite under the workload. Not that there is an obstruction, but we are asking for too much airflow.
