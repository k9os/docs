# Nose Breathing

Studies show that during anaerobic \(without oxygen\) exercise it is common to see a switch from nasal breathing to oral-nasal breathing. That is attributed to the resistance of airflow through the nose. Nasal breathing converts air to temperatures near that of body temperature; increasing its humidity; and acting as a filter by extracting contaminants.
