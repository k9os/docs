# Nose Breathing

Studies show that during anaerobic \(without oxygen\) exercise, it is common to see a switch from nasal breathing to oral-nasal breathing. That is related to the resistance of airflow through the nose. Respiratory noises such as snorting are indicators of airway obstruction. If snorting occurs, it's likely a result of asking for too much airflow through the nose, not necessarily a block. We may also see vasodilation, which brings blood to the skin's surface, allowing it to cool before returning to the heart. We may see this in the eyes first when working dogs at high workloads.
