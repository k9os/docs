> “Strong opinions, weakly held.”

We are using intuition to guide us to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect. Next, we can prove ourselves wrong and engage in doubt. We are looking for information that doesn’t fit. Potentially indicators that point us in an entirely different direction. Ultimately, a new hypothesis will emerge, ready to go through the process once again.

> I'm excited to take two things I'm passionate about and merge them to further educate myself and the community efficiently through skills I learned during my career in information technology. Systems should be designed with decisions records, delivery practices, testing, and measurable metrics to show progress—all with the relentless pursuit of continuous improvement.
