# Delivery

With dog training, it should be fair to say we are building an input-output system. In most cases, we provided the input as a handler, and in other cases, there is some outside source of information, both resulting in a desired output from the dog.

## Principals

There are three principles at the heart of the delivery system:

* Build quality in
* Work in small batches
* Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement

### Build Quality in

It’s easier to fix problems if we find them immediately—ideally before they cause a more significant issue by running tests as early as possible. These tests should not be at a level where avoidance might occur if applying various pressure to the dog. Finding problems downstream is time-consuming, requiring significant triage. Then we must fix the problem, trying to recall what we thought when we introduced it.

Creating and evolving feedback loops to detect problems as early as possible is essential and never-ending work in the delivery system. If we find a problem downstream, we must fix it and ask: How could we have caught the problem earlier?

### Work in small batches

We want to reduce the time it takes to get feedback on our training and make it easier to triage and remediate problems. Working in small batches will help with that and increase efficiency.

### Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement

Continuous improvement is a practice inspired by the Japanese concept of “Kaizen.” It suggests subtle and gradual improvement achieved over time. Treat Improvement work as an essential part of daily work, where nobody is satisfied with the status quo.
