# About

### Open Source

[Open source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source) is a term that originally referred to open source software for computer systems. It has since become a way of working that reaches out beyond the scope of software production. We can use this model to find new ways to solve problems in our industry.

### Peer Production

[Peer production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_production) is a way of producing goods and services that relies on self-organizing communities of individuals. In such communities, the labor of many people is coordinated towards a shared outcome.
