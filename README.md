# Welcome!

A dog training system designed to support the unique needs of each dog and handler. Not by suggesting a single method, but several with documented drivers and trade-offs to reach the desired outcome. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The concepts and information on this site are currently in the design phases. It is currently targeted at people interested in dissecting the details in current K9 training methods and organizing them in a way where we can successfully communicate and iterate on.

### Open Source

[Open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) is a term that originally referred to open source software for computer systems. It has since become a way of working that reaches out beyond the scope of software production. We can use this model to find new ways to solve problems in our industry.

### Peer Production

[Peer production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_production) is a way of producing goods and services that relies on self-organizing communities of individuals. In such communities, the labor of many people is coordinated towards a shared outcome.
